LH.Count <- read.csv("/Users/apatte21/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/00 - CLEAR Lab (Locked Folders)/02 - Data Management, Analysis, and Papers/Studies_Projects/UKALC/02_datasets/UKALC_DAILY/01_raw_data/OvulationDates.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
